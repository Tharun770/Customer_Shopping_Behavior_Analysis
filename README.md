## üêç Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("customer_shopping_behavior.csv")

# Check structure and summary
df.info()
df.describe()

# Handle missing values in review_rating
df['review_rating'] = df.groupby('category')['review_rating'].transform(
    lambda x: x.fillna(x.median())
)

# Rename columns to snake_case
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')

# Feature engineering
bins = [0, 25, 40, 60, 100]
labels = ['Youth', 'Adult', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior']
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=bins, labels=labels)

# Create purchase frequency column
df['purchase_frequency_days'] = (df['last_purchase_date'] - df['first_purchase_date']).dt.days

# Drop redundant column
df.drop('promo_code_used', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Connect to PostgreSQL and upload cleaned data
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/customer_db")
df.to_sql("customer_shopping_behavior", engine, index=False, if_exists='replace')
```

## üßÆ SQL Business Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Below are key business queries used to derive insights:

### 1. Revenue by Gender

```sql
SELECT gender, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY gender;
```

### 2. High-Spending Discount Users

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
WHERE discount_applied = TRUE
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(purchase_amount) > (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM customer_shopping_behavior);
```

### 3. Top 5 Products by Rating

```sql
SELECT item_purchased, ROUND(AVG(review_rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Shipping Type Comparison

```sql
SELECT shipping_type, ROUND(AVG(purchase_amount), 2) AS avg_purchase
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY shipping_type;
```

### 5. Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers

```sql
SELECT subscription_status, COUNT(*) AS total_orders, ROUND(AVG(purchase_amount), 2) AS avg_spend
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY subscription_status;
```

### 6. Discount-Dependent Products

```sql
SELECT item_purchased, 
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN discount_applied = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS discount_percentage
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY discount_percentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 7. Customer Segmentation

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       CASE
           WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN 'New'
           WHEN COUNT(*) BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN 'Returning'
           ELSE 'Loyal'
       END AS customer_segment
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 8. Top 3 Products per Category

```sql
SELECT category, item_purchased, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY category, item_purchased
QUALIFY RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) <= 3;
```

### 9. Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 5 THEN 'Frequent Buyer' ELSE 'Occasional Buyer' END AS buyer_type,
    SUM(CASE WHEN subscription_status = 'Subscribed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS subscribers
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 10. Revenue by Age Group

```sql
SELECT age_group, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_shopping_behavior
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
